# Face Obsucration Using Big Data Techniques

In this paper we investigate some of the techniques that are used 
for face recognition so that we can find the faces in sensitive data, 
and automatically blur them to anonymize the people in the videos. 
This is an effort to aid the UNM school of engineering's project, 
"Advancing out of school learning in mathematics and engineering" 
or AOLME. This approach is by no means novel, but is more of 
an investigation of applying computer vision algorithms at a 
"big-data" scale.
